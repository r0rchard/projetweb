### Christophe Clifford & Delcombel Nicolas
# Aim
We created a website made for an experimenter who want to make surveys using the attrack diff questionary (http://www.attrakdiff.de/index-en.html). He/She can access and manage survey via his/her account. Users can access and pass surveys using their own account. The results are stocked in a database and can be downloaded in a .csv file.
